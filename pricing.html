faqs:
  - pregunta: How do you determine cleaning prices?
    respuesta: Our pricing is based on your space's size and specific needs. We charge by the job, not by the hour, so you know exactly what you'll pay upfront. <strong>What we quote is what you pay</strong> - no surprise fees or hidden charges ever.
  - pregunta: Are you insured against damages or theft?
    respuesta: Yes! We carry $2 million in liability insurance and bond all employees. <strong>Every team member undergoes thorough background checks</strong> and is directly employed by us - no contractors or temporary staff.
  - pregunta: What cleaning products do you use?
    respuesta: We use only <strong>premium, eco-friendly cleaning solutions</strong> that are tough on dirt but safe for your family, pets, and the environment. All products meet EPA Safer Choice standards and are hypoallergenic.
  - pregunta: Do I need to sign a contract for regular service?
    respuesta: No contracts required! <strong>Stay because you want to, not because you have to</strong>. Regular clients enjoy significant discounts (up to 25%) and priority scheduling while maintaining complete flexibility.
  - pregunta: How do you ensure cleaning quality?
    respuesta: Every cleaning follows our <strong>50-point quality checklist</strong>, and all team members complete 120+ hours of hands-on training. Plus, we guarantee your satisfaction - if you're not amazed, we'll re-clean for free.
  - pregunta: What training do your cleaners receive?
    respuesta: Our professionals complete <strong>comprehensive certification training</strong> including proper cleaning techniques, safety protocols, and eco-friendly practices. Ongoing training ensures we stay current with the latest cleaning innovations.
