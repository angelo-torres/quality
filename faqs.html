    <div>
      <h3>Pricing & Services</h3>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How do you determine cleaning prices?</h4>
        <p>Our pricing is based on your space's size and specific needs. Standard home cleaning starts at $129 for spaces up to 1,500 sq ft. We provide exact quotes upfront - no hidden fees ever.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>What's included in a standard cleaning?</h4>
        <p>Our standard service includes thorough cleaning of all rooms: dusting, vacuuming, mopping, bathroom sanitization, kitchen cleaning, and surface wiping. Deep cleaning services include extras like inside appliances and baseboards.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Do you offer regular cleaning discounts?</h4>
        <p>Yes! Weekly clients save 25%, bi-weekly save 20%, and monthly clients save 15%. Plus, new clients save 20% on their first cleaning.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Booking & Scheduling</h3>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How far in advance should I book?</h4>
        <p>We recommend booking 3-5 days ahead for regular cleaning, though we often have same-week availability. For special events or move-out cleaning, 1-2 weeks notice is ideal.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>What if I need to reschedule?</h4>
        <p>No problem! We require 48 hours notice for rescheduling to avoid any fees. Regular clients can reschedule up to 4 times per year with no questions asked.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Do you offer same-day service?</h4>
        <p>Yes! We keep slots open daily for urgent needs. Call before 10 AM for potential same-day service (additional fee may apply).</p>

      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Will I get the same cleaners each time?</h4>
        <p>Yes! Regular clients are assigned a primary cleaning team that remains consistent. We believe in building trust through familiar faces.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How do you handle home access?</h4>
